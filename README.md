# neopixel_fft
Neopixel visualizer for audio FFT signal

Using the example from: http://www.swharden.com/wp/2013-05-09-realtime-fft-audio-visualization-with-python/

Visualized the fft from the microphone on my webcam over 300 neopixels. 

Starting with the lower frequencies, going up (in a log-ish mannor) to higher frequencies, low db=blue going to green, then red.
